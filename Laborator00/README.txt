Minishell
=========

Minishell is a platform-independent shell writen in Java (exploring the New I/O API), supporting commands (though without any options) to manipulate the content of the file system (files and directories).


In the case of overwriting existing files or deleting non-empty directories, the user will be prompted whether he/she is sure to do so.

There is no support at the moment for symbolic links.

* v1.1.0
Added support for:
 - cat <file>: displays the content of the file

* v1.0.0
The commands supported so far are:
 - cd <new_directory>: changes the current directory to the new_directory, which may denote a relative or an absolute path
 - mkdir <new_directory> / md <new_directory>: creates a new directory within the current directory, if the parameter is a relative path, or at the exact location specified by an absolute path
 - touch <new_file> / touch <existing_file>: creates a new file with the specified content; appends the specified content to an existing file; the content is to be added line by line until /quit is entered
 - quit / exit: terminates the program
